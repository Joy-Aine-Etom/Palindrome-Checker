    A Man, A Plan, A Canal, Panama!
</h2>

Sai is a programmer known for his attention to detail. One evening, while enjoying a cup of coffee at his favorite cafÃ©, he overhears a conversation between two friends. They are discussing their recent visit to a local bookstore, where they discovered a collection of books with interesting titles. The friends are excitedly sharing some examples, including one intriguing title: A Man, a Plan, a Canal, Panama!

Sai's curiosity is piqued, and he realizes that the given title is a classic example of a palindrome (which is a word, number, or phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar). Inspired by this coincidence, he decides to create a program that will determine whether a given string is a palindrome or not.

Your task is to help Sai do this task.

### Input
